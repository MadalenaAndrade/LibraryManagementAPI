# Library Management API (Ongoing Development)
This is an ongoing training project where I am building a RESTful API to manage a fictitious library database, using **ASP.NET Core** and **Entity Framework Core**. The goal is to practice API development and database management concepts, with incremental improvements and new features being added over time.
The database was created using the **Code First** approach, based on a similar [SQL repository](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryDB-SQL-Scripts/blob/main/FullLibraryQuery.sql) I have worked on. Additionally, among new concepts I am using this project to learn **Entity Framework Core**, an **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** for .NET, as I was previously unfamiliar with it.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core** - For building the RESTful API
- **Entity Framework Core** - For database management
- **C#** - Main programming language
- **SQL Server** - For data storage
- **Swagger / Swashbuckle** - For API documentation

## üöÄ Current Progress
- **Code First approach** - Creating models and DbContext using **data annotations** and **Fluent API**
- **Database migration** configured
- **Basic CRUD operations** implemented 
- **DTOs** added for structured data transfer
- **Initial exception handling** and **custom attributes** setup
- **Swagger UI** integrated for API documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
This project is still in active development, and its structure and features may change as improvements are made.
